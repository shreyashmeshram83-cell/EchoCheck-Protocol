🌫️ EchoCheck: Reclaiming the Human Layer
The Problem: The Dead Internet is Here
By 2026, over 60% of internet traffic is synthetic. Standard CAPTCHAs (finding fire-hydrants) are trivial for modern AI to solve. We are losing the ability to tell if the person on the other side of the screen is a biological human or a high-fidelity AI script.

The Solution: Biological Micro-Signals
EchoCheck is a next-generation "Humanity-as-a-Service" widget. Instead of annoying puzzles, it uses the laws of physics.

Every human movement—whether a mouse glide or a finger swipe—contains Organic Noise (micro-tremors and non-linear acceleration) that AI agents cannot yet replicate without looking "mathematically perfect."

Key Features-
Invisible Defense: No puzzles, no clicks. It verifies you while you naturally interact with the UI.

Edge-AI Detection: Uses a lightweight TensorFlow.js model to analyze movement patterns locally in the browser.
Privacy-First: Zero biometric data (faces/fingerprints) is stored or sent to a server. We only care about the physics of the motion.
Anti-Agentic: Specifically designed to detect and block "Agentic AI" (automated scripts that mimic human behavior).

How it Works
Capture: High-frequency monitoring of mousemove and touchstart events.
Analyze: Extracts "Biological Entropy" (Jitter, Velocity Curves, and Fitts's Law compliance).
Verify: Generates a Proof-of-Humanity token if the interaction matches a biological signature.
